# Types of machine learning algorithms

## Supervised Learning

### It models relationships and dependancies between the target prediction output and the input features  such that we can predict the output values for the new data based on those relationships which it learned from previous data sets.
### It is a predictive model, we have labeled data, includes regression adn classification.

### List of supervised algorithms

#### Nearest neighbor
#### Naive Bayes
#### Decision trees
#### Linear regression
#### Support Vector Machines(SVM)
#### Neural Networks

## Unsupervised Learning

### It mainly deals with pattern detection adn descriptive modeling. They are trained with unlabelled data. They use techniques on input data to mine for rules, detect patterns, and summerize and group the data points. 
### It is a descriptive model, includes clustering and association rule.

### List of unsupervised learning

#### k-means clustering
#### Association rules

## Semi supervised learning

### It is a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning. It is the best algorithm when the cost and human efforts are considered. It has unlabeled data but data carries important information about the group parameters

## Reinforcement learning

### Also known as agent, continuously learns from the environment in an iterative fashion. It will either maximize the rward or minimize the risk. It is a branch of Artificial Intelligence. It automatically tends to determine the behavious to increase the performance. The repitation of decision making is known as Markov Decision Process. 

### List of algorithms

#### Q-Learning
#### Temporal Difference(TD)
#### Deep Adversarial Networks
